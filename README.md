# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**

## **Overview of Project**
The purpose of this analysis is to develop skills in SQL by undertanding structure of tables using `ERD (Entity Relationship Diagramas)` that help to visualize the databases for holding data. 
During the challenge Visual Studio Code (VS Code) helped to create SQL queries by using a code editor with the ability to execute the queries that was created. 

## **Results**
The queries results are lists that answer questions about insights of the data. SQL is a great tool to do research and identify the `Primary Key` and `Foreign Key` of the databases.
